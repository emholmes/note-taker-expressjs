# Note Taker
## Express.js Challenge

## Description 
This repository contains code for a note taking application. The purpose of this challenge assignment is to connect the back end to the front end using Express.js. Configuring the back end required setting up HTML and API routes, with GET, POST, and DELETE request methods, using a db.json file to store and retrieve the notes. This application is deployed using Heroku.
